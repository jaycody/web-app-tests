- [IEEE 829-2008] - Standard for Software and System Test Documentation (STD)
  - Description: Test processes determine whether the development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of that activity and whether the system and/or software satisfies its intended use and user needs. Testing process tasks are specified for different integrity levels. These process tasks determine the appropriate breadth and depth of test documentation. The documentation elements for each type of test documentation can then be selected. The scope of testing encompasses software-based systems, computer software, hardware, and their interfaces. This standard applies to software-based systems being developed, maintained, or reused (legacy, commercial off-the-shelf, Non-Developmental Items). The term "software" also includes firmware, microcode, and documentation. Test processes can include inspection, analysis, demonstration, verification, and validation of software and software-based system products.  

- [IEEE 1012-2012] - Standard for System and Software Verification and Validation (SVVP)
  - Description: Verification and validation (V&V) processes are used to determine whether the development products of a given activity conform to the requirements of that activity and whether the product satisfies its intended use and user needs. V&V life cycle process requirements are specified for different integrity levels. The scope of V&V processes encompasses systems, software, and hardware, and it includes their interfaces. This standard applies to systems, software, and hardware being developed, maintained, or reused [legacy, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), nondevelopmental items]. The term software also includes firmware and microcode, and each of the terms system, software, and hardware includes documentation. V&V processes include the analysis, evaluation, review, inspection, assessment, and testing of products.

- [IEEE 730-2014]  - Standard for Software Quality Assurance Processes (SQAP)
  - Description: Requirements for initiating, planning, controlling, and executing the Software Quality Assurance processes of a software development or maintenance project are established in this standard. This standard is harmonized with the software life cycle process of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2008 and the information content requirements of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2011
