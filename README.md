##Web App Test Automation
prototype test plan and automation scripts for random webapp

________________________

###Project Overview
1. Elucidate app's existing worklow
    - what does it do?
2. Transform the workflow into test scripts
    - automate verification of what it supposed to do (Selenium WebDriver, Python)
3. Regard test scripts as software worthy of maintainence and version-control
    - hey!  this is legitimate software devlopment
4. Automate regression testing based on changes to code base.
    - now automate the execution of the automated tests (Jenkins, github, SauceLabs)
5. Use the test results!
    - pipe test output as an input into appropriate team (analytics)

###Assessment Phase for the new Automation Engineer
1. Learn who's who.
    - introductions, roles, responsibilties
2. Learn the workflow and generate a UI sketch 
    - use [interactive sketching notation] and Illustrator
3. Define requirements for fucntional testing
    - Can't test everything, so what are we most concerned with? 
    - create the input, determine the output, compare to expected 
4. Determine what to do with test results?  Who receives the auto emails upon failure?  Texts?
    - Decision makers want timely reports!
5. Determine who writes the scripts, who runs the sripts, and who's waiting for results
6. Identify process and next steps

####Assessment for Version 2:
- Define and test the operational requirments (version 2 features)
    - eg. Performance, Stress and Volume

###Create Project Plan From Assessment
1. Test Plan
2. Method
3. Prototype
4. Feedback and Recommendations
5. Roadmap and Long Range
6. TimeLines
7. Build It

###Test Plan
- {magik here}

###Method
- test scripts - (Selenium Webdrivr, Python)
- error reporting - (pytest, unittests, SauceLabs)
- interface for developers - (command line)
- automated regression tests (Jenkins, SauceLabs, Github)
